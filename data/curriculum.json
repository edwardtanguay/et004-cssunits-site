									"front": "What are the main distributions of Linux today?",
									"back": "- Debian based\n\t- **Debian** (1993)\n\t\t- popular in server space\n\t\t- two package managers, apt and aptitude\n\t\t\t- apt was part of Debian’s .deb package; however, it was updated to work with the RPM Package Manager.\n\t\t\t- aptitude is a front-end tool\n\t\t- dpkg [DEE-package]\n\t- **Ubuntu** (2003)\n\t\t- most popular Linux distribution today\n\t\t- uses apt package manager\n\t\t- has a lot more drivers than Debian\n\t\t- Debian and Ubuntu are similar\n\t\t\t- Debian more of a server distribution\n\t\t\t- Ubuntu more of a personal laptop distribution\n\t- **Mint** (2006)\n\t\t- based on Ubuntu\n\t\t- started out with pre-installed multimedia codecs and proprietary drivers\n\t\t- good for beginners\n\t- *elementary OS* (2011)\n\t\t- promotes itself as a \"thoughtful, capable, and ethical\" replacement to macOS and Windows and has a pay-what-you-want model\n\t\t- desktop environment: Pantheon\n\t- *Kali* (2013)\n\t\t- designed for digital forensics and penetration testing\n\t\t- primary tool used by ethical hackers\n\t\t- allows you to test networks to see if they're vulnerable to outside attacks\n- RPM based\n\t- **RedHat** (1995)\n\t\t- known as RHEL (RedHat Enterprise Linux)\n\t\t- created the rpm package format \n\t\t- uses yum\n\t\t\t- RPM is autonomous and utilizes its own database to keep information about the packages on the system\n\t\t\t- YUM is a front-end utility that uses the RPM package manager for package management\n\t- **Fedora** (2003)\n\t\t- uses newer technology and packages from the open source world than RHEL\n\t\t- uses yum package manager as does RHEL\n\t\t- Fedora releases often while CentOS is more stable\n\t\t- **suited for workstation applications and non-production servers**\n\t\t- every six months a version like Ubuntu\n\t\t- DNF package manager\n\t- **CentOS** (2004)\n\t\t- functionally compatible with RHEL\t\n\t\t- focuses on the stability and robustness\n\t\t- used when you need a more stable system that requires the RHEL’s feature set\n\t\t- its successor is Rocky Linux\n\t\t- on CentOS you'll find older packages, on Fedora, typically new ones\n\t\t- **on December 8, 2020, Red Hat announced that development of CentOS Linux would be discontinued**\n\t- *Suse Linux* (1994)\n\t\t- known for its YaST configuration tool\n\t\t- known for the KDE desktop and stability\n\t\t- for package management uses zypper and its graphical fronted, the Yast software center\n\t\t- 2003 Novell bought Suse\n\t\t- 2005 the openSUSE Project\n\t\t\t- Zypper package manager\n\t\t- **over time, SuSE Linux incorporated many aspects of Red Hat Linux, such as its RPM Package Manager and its file structure**\n\t- **Rocky Linux** (2021)\n\t\t- complete binary-compatible release using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system source code\n\t\t- aim is to provide a community-supported, production-grade enterprise operating\n\t\t- Rocky Linux is considered the unofficial successor to CentOS, a fork of RHEL\n\t\t- Rocky Linux has no corporate backing, while Alma is controlled by the CloudLinux people\n\t- *AlmaLinux* (2021)\n\t\t- AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux are the two brightest shining stars since CentOS ceded its position as a reliable RHEL-based server operating system\n\t\t- nonprofit\n\t\t- first version February 2021\n\t\t- totally compatible with RedHat\n- other distributions\n\t- *Slackware* (1992)\n\t\t- oldest Linux distribution in use today\n\t\t- does not have a package manager and all the software is compiled by the system administrator or normal users of the system\n\t\t- packages are simply source code\n\t\t- if you really want to learn a lot about how Linux really works, use Slackware\n\t- *FreeBSD* (1993)\n\t\t- offered at DigitalOcean\n\t\t- FreeBSD has similarities with Linux, with two major differences in scope and licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete system, i.e. the project delivers a kernel, device drivers, userland utilities, and documentation, as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers, and relying on third-parties for system software\n\t\t- pkg package management system\n\t\t- much of FreeBSD's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems such as Darwin (the basis for macOS)\n\t\t\t- and the system software for the PlayStation \n\t- *Gentoo* (2002)\n\t\t- based on the portage package management system\n\t\t- can be difficult to install \n\t\t\t- advantage of such an approach is that the software is built for the specific hardware that it will be running on\n\t- **Arch** (2002)\n\t\t- default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required\n\t\t- uses pkg.tar.xz packages and has it's own **package manager called pacman**\n\t\t- does not come with a graphical installer and the whole installation process is done via a terminal\n\t\t- main philosophy behind Arch is KISS \n\t\t- makes few assumptions about how you want your system to be configured\n\t\t\t- Arch starts form a very neutral place\n\t\t\t- this makes the installation process confusing\n\t\t- has rolling release so there are no large versions\n\t\t- uses systemd system management framework\n\t\t- installation\n\t\t\t- can choose template, e.g. server or desktop\n\t\t\t- go to https://archlinux.org/download\n\t\t\t- download image\n\t\t\t- virtual box\n\t\t\t- it immediatly goes to root user\n\t\t\t- `archinstall` is easier\n\t\t\t- asks many questions, e.g. file system: ext4\n\t\t\t- leave root password blank to disable account\n\t\t\t- provide name for superuser account\n\t\t\t- choose desktop\n\t\t\t- linux kernel\n\t\t\t- poweroff\n\t\t- using after installation\n\t\t\t- `sudo pacman -Syu` = update system\n\t\t\t- you can install groups: https://archlinux.org/groups\n\t\t- see the [Wiki entry for principles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux#Principles)\n\t\t- targeted at power users\n\t- *Alpine* (2005)\n\t\t- designed to be small, simple and secure\n\t\t- uses musl and BusyBox instead of the more commonly used Glibc and GNU Core Utilities\n\t\t- because of its small size, it is commonly used in containers providing quick boot-up times\n\t- *Manjaro* (2011)\n\t\t- based on the Arch Linux operating system that has a focus on user-friendliness \n\t\t- uses Pacman\n\t\t- developed mainly in Austria, France and Germany\n\t\t- easier to use\n\t- *EndeavourOS* (2019)\n\t\t- based on Arch Linux\n\t\t- seen as a workstation\n\t\t- features the graphical Calamares installer capable of installing the Xfce, Budgie, Cinnamon, GNOME, i3, KDE Plasma 5, LXQt, and MATE desktop environments\n\t\t- not as mature as other distributions\t\t\t",

GitHub Classroom**\n\t- you push directly to default directory\n\t- Code Buddy is installed to check your work automatically\n\t- branching is not used or needed in this use-case of Git and GitHub\n- **2. team projects** - numerous developers\n\t- this is what Git and GitHub are mostly used for in companies and open source developer teams\n\t- this is the reason Linus created Git: to manage code in large projects of many developers\n\t- our course website is an example of this, which gives you experience of working in project teams\n\t\t- you have to work in an organized fashion to avoid chaos and conflicts\n\t\t\t- a developer team has a project board like we have: [WD23-D04 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/WD23-D04/projects/1/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Labels%22%5D)\n\t\t- you check out tasks, then accomplish them\n\t\t\t- you create a **task branch**\n\t\t\t- when finished you create a **pull request**\n\t\t\t- you **merge** your pull request into the dev branch\n\t\t\t\t- if there are conflicts, you **resolve the conflicts**\n\t\t\t- the main work flow is described here: http://localhost:3500/documentation\n\t\t- there is one more step which we don't use yet in our course website and repository: **deployment**\n\t\t\t- if our website was being published online\n\t\t\t- we would have a main branch as well\n\t\t\t- we would develop our site by working on task branches which we merge into dev\n\t\t\t- as a team, we would have e.g. two-week **sprints** in which we have a specific collection of tasks to accomplish\n\t\t\t- at the end of the sprint when all tasks are accomplished and tested in dev, the repository manager would locally merge **dev** into **main**, then push main to the GitHub repository\n\t\t\t- this would trigger DevOps processes which then pull the changes and push them to the live servers\n\t\t- there can be another step before deployment called **testing**\n\t\t\t- the repository manager merges **dev** into **testing** and pushes this to the repository\n\t\t\t- this triggers DevOps processes which push the changes to testing servers that are online\n\t\t\t\t- automatic end-to-end tests are performed on the live data\n\t\t\t\t- manual tests are performed: you can use the site live with smart phones etc.\n\t\t\t- then when all tests pass, the repository managers merges the **testing branch** into the **main branch** and pushes it to the GitHub repository so it gets deployed live\n\t\t- there are many variations on this workflow and various philosophies of how teams should work with GitHub\n\t\t\t- each company and team has a slightly different process\n\t\t\t- but you find these basic concepts in all workflows:\n\t\t\t\t- dev\n\t\t\t\t- testing\n\t\t\t\t- main"

											"body": "- CSS has so many options, features and possibilities, it is important to choose a strategy which will\n\t- keep your site scalable to various size screens\n\t- enable you to change the site's layout quickly and accurately\n- my strategy is to use\n\t- **rem** for everything that should be scalable, which is usually everything on the site\n\t- **px** for everything that needs to be absolute, e.g. perhaps padding so that text does not get too close to the edges of its parent\n\t- **Sass** to be able to define similar size values as a variable so that, e.g. I can change the padding between all items in one place\n\t\t- in addition the nesting option of Sass makes CSS much easier to use and understand, particularly in large stylesheets\n\t- **vh**/**vw** I use to stretch site-background images across the whole site\n\t- **%** and **em** I practically don't use\n- the site we want to make looks like this:##thesitewithcssunits\n- you can find the code in the course site here:\n\t- `backend\\data\\users\\edward\\sites\\cssunits`\n\t- this is HTML/CSS only and so does not use Sass\n- to use Sass, you need to install it as an npm package\n\t- this requires that you have some kind of framework with a web bundler\n\t- Vite works very well for this for HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites\n\t- code is here: [https://github.com/edwardtanguay/et003-cssunits-site](https://github.com/edwardtanguay/et003-cssunits-site)\n\t- create site\n\t\t- `npm create vite`\n\t\t\t- <site name> e.g. `et003-cssunit-site`\n\t\t\t- Vanilla\n\t\t\t- JavaScript\n\t- start VSCode\n\t\t- `code et003-cssunit-site`\n\t\t- `npm i`\n\t\t- `npm run dev`\n\t\t- `git init -b dev`\n\t- minimalize site##nothingsmini\n\t- copy in code from first site (first without Sass)\n\t- install Sass\n\t\t- `npm i sass`\n\t\t- change name to `style.scss`\n\t\t- convert to nested styles\n\t\t- create `$main-padding: 1.2rem` variable\n- publish at Vercel\n\t- push final commit to GitHub\n\t- setup site at Vercel\n\t- finished site is here: [https://et003-cssunits-site.vercel.app](https://et003-cssunits-site.vercel.app)##thesitewithcssunits\n",
